# Fuel Efficiency Calculator

This Python program calculates the fuel efficiency (MPG) of a multi-leg journey based on user input.  
It asks for odometer readings and gallons of fuel used for each leg of a trip, and calculates:

- MPG for each leg  
- Total MPG for the full trip  

The project was developed as part of my Python programming coursework.

## Features

- Input validation  
- While loop for multi-step input  
- MPG math calculation  
- Clean, formatted output  

## Technologies Used

- Python (basic syntax, math, input/output)  
- Text-based user interface  

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.  
2. Run the script in your terminal or IDE.  
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to input your journey details.  

## What I Learned

This project helped me understand:

- Loops and conditionals  
- Data storage using lists  
- User input handling  
- MPG calculations with real-world logic  

## Status

Completed â€“ uploaded to GitHub to showcase my understanding of Python basics and program flow control.
