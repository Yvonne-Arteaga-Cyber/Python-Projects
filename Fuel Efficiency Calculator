# Fuel Efficiency Calculator

This Python program calculates the fuel efficiency (MPG) of a multi-leg journey based on user input. It asks for odometer readings and gallons of fuel used for each leg of a trip, and calculates:

- MPG for each leg  
- Total MPG for the full trip

It uses loops, conditionals, list storage, and formatted output. This was developed as a class project during my Python programming course.

### Features:
- Input validation  
- While loop for multi-step input  
- MPG math calculation  
- Clean, readable formatted output  

### Technologies Used:
- Python (basic syntax, math, input/output)  
- Text-based user interface
